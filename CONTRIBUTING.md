# Contributing to Plumeria

We truly value your interest in contributing to Plumeria! Your help is invaluable, and we're grateful for your efforts in improving this project. Here are some guidelines to get you started.

## Development Setup

Our project uses `pnpm`. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Clone the repository.
2. In the root directory, run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
3. To check the test correctly, run `pnpm run test` to unit testing the necessary api.
4. If you make any modifications, please test your changes. We prefer new features to come with tests.
5. If you update any files under the `packages/` dir, don't forget to run `npx changeset`.

## Package Structure

Our project is organized into several packages within the `packages` directory:

- **@plumeria/collection**: This package contains all the items needed for Plumeria.
- **@plumeria/compiler**: This package contains the code required to compile Plumeria.
- **@plumeria/core**: This is a core package that combines the above two and zss-engine as dependencies.

## Adding a changeset

Versioning uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).  
Don't forget to generate a changeset if you make changes to packages.

You can generate a changeset using the following command.

```sh
npx changeset
```

Also commit the `.md` file generated by hitting the command.
