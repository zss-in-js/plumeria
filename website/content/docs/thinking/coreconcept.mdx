<Steps>
<Step>
## Precompilation

Plumeria's compilation logic is not coupled with the framework's build.
The fully independent compilation process does not interfere with the framework's build process, allowing CSS to be safely and deterministically
included in the build process.
</Step>
<Step>
## Debugging

Since all styles are resolved at compile time, runtime uncertainties are completely eliminated.
Statically determined CSS allows developers to identify all style issues at compile time.
</Step>
<Step>
## Performance

Semantic properties help avoid HTML pollution.
Short hashes minimize the amount of CSS.
</Step>
<Step>
## Optimization

Style objects passed across component boundaries are all Tree shaking at build time.
Production bundle size does not include objects, and only lightweight CSS remains.
Also, because it is always written outside the component, the object is not rendered.
</Step>
<Step>
## Hashes

The create method takes the key as the class name and gives a 6-character hash of the object at the end.
Class names are changed by objects, but when objects are determined, class names become universal.
Therefore, when methods are determined, class names can be used as CSS Syntax arguments (has and not, is where eg.)
The same object hash and the same `key` are used in both `development and production` environments,
Developers can easily find it.
