## Library Profiles

### StyleX

**StyleX** is a Meta-developed, zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library designed for large-scale apps.  
It provides high performance and type safety, but requires **Babel configuration** and may feel rigid for smaller projects or rapid prototyping.

### Pigment-CSS

**Pigment-CSS** is a performant and developer-friendly zero-runtime library.  
It compiles type-safe styles with minimal configuration, and supports modern features like server components.  
However, the ecosystem is still maturing, and custom tooling may be needed for deeper integration.
