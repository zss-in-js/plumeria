## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a powerful framework that handles utility classes based on atomic CSS.
Surrounding libraries such as `headlessui` and `shadcn/ui` are also well-developed.
However, one of the drawbacks of Tailwind is that definitions tend to be redundant, resulting in the screen appearing the same no matter who creates it.

### When to use Plumeria?

For most web applications, vanilla CSS is no longer enough. These days, you need UI frameworks, CSS-in-JS, client-side styling, etc.  


`@plumeria` is a strong choice if you want to quickly implement a type-safe feedback cycle
