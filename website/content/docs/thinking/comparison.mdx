## StyleX

StyleX is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library developed by Meta, focusing on scalable and predictable styling. It offers type-safe, object-based styles compiled at build time, ensuring minimal runtime overhead. StyleX is well-suited for large-scale applications but may require additional configuration for complex dynamic styling compared to Plumeria.

## Pigment-CSS

Pigment-CSS is a modern, zero-runtime styling library optimized for performance and developer experience. It leverages type-safe, object-based styles and compiles efficiently at build time. Pigment-CSS integrates seamlessly with modern frameworks and server components, though its ecosystem is still growing compared to more established solutions.

### When to use Plumeria?

For most web applications, vanilla CSS falls short of modern needs like UI frameworks, CSS-in-JS, and client-side styling. Plumeria stands out when you need:

- Lightning-fast compile times to streamline development and CI/CD pipelines.
- Type-safe, zero-runtime styling with minimal bundle size.
- A simple, CLI-driven workflow that integrates effortlessly with existing bundlers.

Choose @plumeria for a fast, type-safe feedback cycle without compromising on build performance.
