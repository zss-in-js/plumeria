# Welcome to Plumeria

Plumeria is a **zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library** that delivers blazing-fast performance with full type safety.
Style at the speed of thought — build faster, debug less, scale effortlessly.


It helps developers focus on **what** to style, not **how** to style it.

## ✨ Why Plumeria?

Plumeria was built with a vision:  
To become the go-to solution for styling in modern front-end development powered by frameworks like React, Vite, and Next.js.

**Plumeria focuses on the following principles:**

- ✅ **Developer Productivity**: Write, compile, and test styles in rapid cycles.
- ✅ **Type-Safe Styling**: Avoid runtime bugs with fully type-checked class names.
- ✅ **Zero Runtime**: No overhead at runtime. All styles are generated at build time.

## 🧩 The Problem with CSS Modules

While CSS Modules offer encapsulation, they lack type safety — leading to:

- Runtime errors from typos
- Difficult refactoring
- Delayed feedback during build

```
[CSS Modules]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Component            │  ← CSS Module is imported in a JSX file  
│ (JSX importing)      │     (e.g., `import styles from './button.module.css'`)  
└──────────────────────┘
            │
            │  CSS is written in an external file
            ▼
┌────────────────────────┐
│ CSS File (.module.css) │  ← Styles are statically defined  
└────────────────────────┘
            │
            │  ※ The bundler (e.g., Webpack) processes  
            │     and hashes class names at build time  
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Build Process (Webpack) │  ← Class names are determined during build  
└─────────────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Generated CSS Output │  ← Hashed class names are output  
│ (Only visible after  │     ※ The final result is unknown until build  
│ building)            │  
└──────────────────────┘

```

## 🧪 The Plumeria Solution

Plumeria decouples CSS compilation from your dev workflow via a CLI, giving you **instant feedback** and static CSS files.

```
[CSS-in-JS (Plumeria)]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
┌──────────────────────┐       ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Component            │───1──▶│ CLI Command Execution   │
│ (JSX with CSS in JS) │       │ (Precompilation)        │
└──────────────────────┘       └─────────────────────────┘
     ▲         ┌─────────────────────────┐           │
     │         │ Generated CSS File      │           │
   3 └─────────│ (Static CSS available)  │ ◀─────────┘ 2
               └─────────────────────────┘  ※ The final result is known at this time
                  │
                4 │
                  │  ※ The following process happens in production builds  
                  ▼
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ Production Build Process      │  ← e.g., Webpack, Vite  
│ (Tree-shaking & Minification) │     ※ Removes used styles  
└───────────────────────────────┘
```



Unlike traditional solutions, you **know exactly what CSS is generated** at authoring time.

## 🏁 Fast Iteration

Plumeria enables a fast write → compile → test cycle.  
This leads to:

- Shorter feedback loops
- Faster debugging
- Higher code quality

> Focus on building beautiful UIs — not wrestling with your styles.
