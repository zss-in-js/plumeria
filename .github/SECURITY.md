| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.6.0   | :white_check_mark: We succeeded in making the compiler independent, which was attempted in 0.3.0.|
| 0.5.1   | :white_check_mark: Problems caused by compression are resolved and created dual packaging. |
| 0.5.0   | :x: Excessive compression with minify has caused the use directive to disappear, causing an fs error in NextJS. |                |ã€€
| 0.4.0   | :white_check_mark: We engaged in a rollback of compiler isolation and temporarily released it as a working version.| 
| 0.3.1   | :x: I rolled back the compiler isolation but the potential error persists.|
| 0.3.0   | :x: This version does not compile is failed with pnpm.|
| 0.2.5   | :white_check_mark: It was relatively stable as a version where core had compiler as a dependency.| 

## Note
Since 0.6.0 the compiler has been made independent, and @plumeria/compiler must be installed when using @plumeria/core.
From 0.5.x onwards, bundle code has been minified and packages are now CJS ESM compatible.  
It is optimized to some extent depending on the required framework.  
@plumeria/next was unstable for a long time, but it has been stable since 0.3.0. It is now a dual package in 0.4.0.
