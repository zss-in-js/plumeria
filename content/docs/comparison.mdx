## Stylex

Plumeria is highly inspired by Stylex. For example, the API's. That is why
`css.keyframes` also exists in Plumeria.

Plumeria also performs optimization during compilation.
If global selectors conflict, they are automatically merged to eliminate unnecessary CSS.
Styles are thinned out by tree shaking, so only CSS files are included in production.

For example, Plumeria is ideal if you want to pass class names directly without merging them, or if you want fine-grained control over CSS by following semantic CSS Syntax.
