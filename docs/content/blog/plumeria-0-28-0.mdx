## v0.28.x - Major Improvements

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- Fixed atomic styles overriding each other with `@layer` support for `next dev` environment

In the case below, there was no need to use `@layer`, but in this case of next-plugin (`webpack-plugin`), it was necessary to use it because separate components are compiled.

- Production environment ( reduce bundle size and reordered by plugin postcss and lightningcss )
- Vite environment ( this cases is client injection only so it was already under controled )

### ✨ API Improvements and change update 
**Renamed `rx` → `x` for better ergonomics and clarity:**
```tsx
// Before
<div {...rx(css.props(styles.bar), { '--width': state + 'px' })} />

// After  
<div {...x(css.props(styles.bar), { '--width': state + 'px' })} />
```

**Reason for choosing `x`?**
- Shorter and more intuitive
- Naming associated with variable expansion
- Framework-agnostic naming

### 📦 Migration Guide

`rx` has been removed and replaced by `x`, so please use `x` for future variable expansion.
