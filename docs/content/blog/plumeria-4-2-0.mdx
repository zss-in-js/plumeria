# Minor Performance Improvements:  
Edge case bugfix and Increases build speed improvements.

We're excited to announce a significant performance update that dramatically improves build speeds and fixes critical collision issues. This release brings three major improvements that will make your development experience noticeably faster.

### 🚀 Optimized Scanning Algorithm: O(n²) → O(n)

We've completely reimplemented our scanning logic with the new `scanAll` function. Previously, the scanner would traverse the codebase multiple times, resulting in O(n²) complexity. Now, with a single-pass algorithm, we've reduced this to O(n), meaning scan times scale linearly with your codebase size.

**Impact**: Projects with large codebases will see the most dramatic improvements, with scan times reduced by orders of magnitude in some cases.

### ⚡ In-Memory Incremental Caching

We've introduced an intelligent in-memory cache that eliminates redundant scanning. Once a file is scanned, the results are cached. The loader no longer needs to rescan everything on each run.

**Impact**: Incremental loading are now blazingly fast. After the initial scan, next loader run only process changed files, dramatically reducing build times during development.

## 🔧 Fixed:
### Table Collision Issues
We've resolved a critical bug where object tables variable name could conflicts. By adding unique IDs as keys, tables are now properly isolated and won't interfere with each other.  
**Impact:** `keyframes` - `viewTransition` - `createStatic` - `createTheme`
### output bug

- Fixed: output of `styles:` variable to be a `type-safe` hashmap

## Improvements Details

These improvements span across all our build tool integrations:

- **turbopack-loader**: optimize for utils impact  
- **webpack-plugin**: optimize for utils impact  
- **vite-plugin**: optimize for utils impact  
- **compiler**: optimize for utils impact
- **utils/parser**: implementation o(n) scan in-memory incremental loader


## What's Next

With these performance foundations in place, we're focusing on stability and developer experience improvements. The current API is solid, and we're committed to maintaining compatibility while exploring new optimization opportunities.
