## features

Managing atomic CSS with style tags was nearly impossible.  
Completely stop injecting with css.props and load dynamically generated css from a plugin to use HMR.  

Hot reloading with use client is only supported by pnpm and is not currently supported by npm.
When using nextjs, it is assumed that you will use pnpm.

vite-plugin also supports frameworks that do not have clients, such as astro.

However, just like use client, we are currently unable to provide smooth hot reloading of the client, so we plan to improve this in the future.
