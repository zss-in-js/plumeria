description: 'Plumeria v6.1.0 Removed x function and changed to namespace import. (3 min read)'

## Changes

- Imports have been changed to individual named exports.

```ts
import { css } from "@plumeria/core"; // old // [!code --]

import * as css from '@plumeria/core'; // new // [!code ++]
// or 
import { create, props, keyframes } from "@plumeria/core";
```
As of version 5.0.0, the following syntax is no longer available:
```ts
const css = require("@plumeria/core") // [!code --]
const { create } = css; // [!code --]
```

## Removed API
The `x` function was removed because it was just a bridge.  
Recommend using React inline styles directly.

```tsx
<div {...x(css.props(styles.color), {"--color": color})}> // [!code --]
<div style={{background: color}}>
```

## Features



**core bundle size is 274 B:**
```mjs
const errorFn = () => {
	throw new Error("Runtime is not supported. Configure the bundler plugin.");
};
const create = (_rule) => errorFn();
const props = (..._rules) => errorFn();
const createTheme = (_rule) => errorFn();
const createStatic = (_rule) => errorFn();
const keyframes = (_rule) => errorFn();
const viewTransition = (_rule) => errorFn();
const variants = (_rule) => (_props) => errorFn();

export { create, createStatic, createTheme, keyframes, props, variants, viewTransition };
```

**The actual bundle size is minified by brotli 182 B:**
```mjs
var e=()=>{throw new Error("Runtime is not supported. Configure the bundler
plugin.")},o=r=>e(),n=(...r)=>e(),s=r=>e(),u=r=>e(),a=r=>e(),c=r=>e(),l=r=>t=>e();
export{o as create,u as createStatic,s as createTheme,a as keyframes,n as props,l
as variants,c as viewTransition};
```

All APIs are non-runtime, runtime bundling is zero because no imports are referenced.

## Others
We've given our APIs individual types.  
This makes it clear that `props`, `create`, and other APIs are statically resolved, as they're displayed in the same color as their `types`.

- Build efficiency improvements
- Loader edge case improvements
- Atomic output edge case improvements
- Documentation improvements
