## Minor Update v2.2.x

### Changed
- `plumerialint` command now uses oxlint internally for faster linting with improved output
- oxlint is now required as a dev dependency for using `plumerialint` command

### Required user project environment
```sh
pnpm install -D oxlint
```

- Significantly faster startup and clearer, colored diagnostics.
