## Changes
This change is a large change for Zero-Runtime and includes large imporvement for Next.js.

These utility APIs have been removed from the core package.

```ts
import { media, ps, px, color } from "@plumeria/core" // [!code --]
```
These can still be imported from the zss-utils package.
```sh
npm i --save-dev zss-utils
```
```ts
import { media, ps, px, color } from "zss-utils" // [!code ++]
```
When using these utilities, it is assumed that you are using a library framework that runs on the client.

## @plumeria/next-plugin has been officially developed.

When developing a plugin that supports SSR, inlining with AST analysis was required. `defineConsts` `defineVars` `defineTheme` `keyframes`.
If you use Next.js you can **register static variables** with **defineConsts** or you can declare variables in the same file to hold media, hover, etc.
In this case, the variable value must be a pure static string literal, and defineConsts also supports inlining of numeric values.

## @plumeria/next has been removed.
With the introduction of 「@plumeria/next-plugin」 , @plumeria/next has now been removed.  
As mentioned in the documentation, you can use next-plugin as follows:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import { withPlumeria } from "@plumeria/next-plugin";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = withPlumeria({
  /* config options here */
});

export default nextConfig;
```
The plugin invokes the virtual-css-loader and injects the virtual CSS corresponding to HMR into the RSC components.


## Added
「[@plumeria/webpack-plugin](https://npmjs.com/package/@plumeria/webpack-plugin)」 has been added.
It can be used for frameworks that mainly use SSR in a webpack environment.
It is a core dependency of 「[@plumeria/next-plugin](https://npmjs.com/package/@plumeria/next-plugin)」.


## BugFix
Previously, @plumeria/next was used to inject style into both the server and client environments, but there was a bug that caused the atom generated on the client to be constructed later, destroying the order defined on the server side.  
@plumeria/next-plugin virtually injects pure CSS on the server side, eliminating style conflicts.

## Other
- Starting with 0.15.0, css.props in @plumeria/core has been modified to only perform client-side injection. This can be used with client-based such as Vite, and SSR can be supported primarily through plugins.
- All package versions are now consistent. From now on, we will update them using unified version control.
- Github and npm The documentation readme has been improved.
