## It has stabilized

The server component is handled by `@plumeria/next-plugin`, and the client injection is handled by `css.props` in `@plumeria/core`.

We came up with two conflict-free approaches.
One was to separate the server and client,
and the other was to add a cartridge on the client side for atoms stacked on top and media queries stacked below, thereby achieving a conflict-free atomic class development screen.

For the above reasons, Plumeria works normally with applications that allow client injection, so Vite does not actually require a plugin, but we distribute a plugin that excludes fs.

0.16.0 was an experimental attempt, but it did not work well, so please use the stable 0.17.0 from now on.
