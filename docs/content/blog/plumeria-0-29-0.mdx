## v0.29.x - Minor Improvements and bugfix [#268](https://github.com/zss-in-js/plumeria/pull/268)

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

### `webpack-plugin & next-plugin`
Bugfix:
- There was an issue where adding a query to @layer would prevent it from being overwritten.
This was resolved by including only the base in the layer.

### `core`
Bugfix:
- Fixed an issue where CSSVariableProperty types could not be handled in queries.

### `eslint-plugin`
Improvements:
- Fixed a bug where the linter would incorrectly warn about "repeat" in `gridTemplate`.


## Other
- Improved documentation top page.

Please use .29.x from now on as these issues have been fixed.
