## v5.0.1

※: `5.0.0` has a bug in the loader (utils logic) of each plugin that causes the hashmap to disappear.
Please use `5.0.1` or later.

## Breaking Change
- Now supports `ESM` only.
- CJS is not supported from v5.0.x onwards.  
Since cjs syntax is not used in Vite Next, we have discontinued support for it due to the ESM that swc can parse and the maintainability considerations, which is a modern library approach that benefits from overwhelming maintainability and tree shaking.




### Improvements
- `postcss-plugin` is no longer started in dev mode, making `next dev` start faster.
- The `Object.assign` processing has been replaced with a `for` statement, `improving build speed`.
