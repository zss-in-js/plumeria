## Features
### Zero Runtime and Zero Bundle
- deprecation of `***bracket variant***` and new `css.variants`
- `props` are now stubbed and in Zero Runtime.
- create is now resolved statically and no longer always leaves a hashmap.

References to imported css objects will be resolved at build time and will no longer reference them, and the bundle will no longer contain `core` code.


## Variants
```tsx
const getButtonStyle = css.variants({
  variant: {
    gradient: styles.gradient,
    metallic: styles.metallic,
  },
  size: {
    small: styles.small,
    medium: styles.medium,
    large: styles.large,
  },
});

interface Props {
  children: ReactNode;
  variant: 'gradient' | 'metallic';
  href: string;
}

export const ButtonLink = ({ children, variant, href }: Props) => {
  return (
    <Link href={href} className={css.props(getButtonStyle({ variant, size: 'medium' }))}>
      {children}
    </Link>
  );
};
// call Components
<Link href={"/docs"} variant="metallic">{...}</Link>
```

If entered at the caller, all patterns will be expanded to className using bitwise expressions.
If entered statically at the definition source of the created getButton, patterns can be saved as bit expressions.


## Improvements
- Conditional expression expansion has been replaced with bitwise operation.  
The role of props for pre-merging operations within the props argument has been moved to the plugin and loader.
This means that props is never called, as it is replaced in all cases.


## Why do we still need props?
It exists for merge processing and conditional expressions in the editor, and the rule that the right wins is also maintained by the plugin.
