# Plumeria v1.0.0

From this version onward, Plumeria’s core no longer performs runtime style injection.

Style HMR is now handled entirely by dedicated plugins and build tools.
The core is focused solely on describing, generating, and optimizing styles — nothing more, nothing less.

This release marks the point where Plumeria's architecture and philosophy are fully defined:
clean separation of responsibilities, plugin-first design, and zero hidden side effects.

This is Plumeria’s true beginning.


## A complete departure from babel-plugin
We were using babel in part with webpack-plugin, but we have now all completely migrated to the most powerful library, `@swc/core`.  
Since the version is fixed within the same project, different `swc` versions will not be included.


## API Probability of consistency
In the client mode of `vite` and `next.js`, variable values could be used as keys and values, but this was possible through client injection.
Now, both next.js and vite have completely transitioned to AST analysis-based plugins. If you want to use variables, you need to specify static literal values using css.defineConsts.

## NextJS
Turbopack-loader construction is complete.
It's ready to use.  
It is also supported via the previous webpack-plugin, so next-plugin compatibility is maintained.


```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import { withPlumeria } from "@plumeria/next-plugin/turbopack"; // [!code ++]
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
};
 
export default withPlumeria(nextConfig);
```
Since the cache may be corrupted every time the next-plugin version changes, we recommend using rimraf to delete it and start it every time.
```json title="package.json"
  "scripts": {
    "predev": "rimraf .next",
    "prebuild": "rimraf .next",
    "dev": "css & next dev",
    "build": "css --type-check && next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
```

## Vite

The official vite-plugin has been born.  
I would like to thank the authors and contributors of the open source `pigment-css` and `linaria`, which we used as references for our vite knowledge.
