The following changes and updates have been made to take full advantage of being an object.

**cx** and **createComposite** have been **integrated** into `css.props()`. The **return value** of `create` has changed from a `string` to an `object`. You can convert it to a hashed key string using `css.props()`.  
There is no cost to `css.props()`, this has already been verified.

You can use css.props() like this:
```tsx
<div className={css.props(styles.text)}>text</div>
```

```ts
import { css } from '@plumeria/core';

const styles css.create({
  text: {
    color: css.color.lightsalmon,  
  },
});
```
`styles.text`, which is type-completed and hovered like this:
```ts
const text: {
    color: "lightsalmon";
}
(property) text: Readonly<{
    readonly color: "lightsalmon";
}>
```



You can create small `CSSProperties` objects and combine them to create `reusable` styles.

## APIs have been added and changed.
\- integrated `css.createComposite()`.  
\- integrated `cx`.
- Add `css.props()`

`css.props()` uses objects as keys in a WeakMap to hold hashed class names, and returns the hashed class names for the object passed in. Unreferenced key-value pairs will be freed by garbage collection.



## Other Fixed:
- refactor: Update Types name  
We have consistently implemented the naming convention "`Selector`" for pseudo-element media queries based on "`Create`" and "`Return`".
