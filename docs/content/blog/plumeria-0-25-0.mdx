## Improvement
The compiler `rscute` has been updated to v1.0.0.  
Supports various import cases.  
Regular expressions have been replaced with AST parsing from `@swc/core`, making it more stable.

## Bugfix
The issue that occurred in v0.24.5 where pseudo-elements were followed by `not(#\#)` has been fixed in `zss-engine`.

Other minor bugs have been fixed in 0.24.x.  
In addition, TSDocs has been added to the API, improving it so that you can link to `documents` by `hovering`.

- fix: fixed precedence of pseudo-element classes and special syntax beginning with "&".
- fix: fixed an issue where flat filtering would not succeed when media filtering occurred



## Appointment
In v0.25.x, we plan to move the compiler closer to **AST parsing** to the extent that there is no difference in performance.

Plumeria's thoughts on nextjs's support for `Turbopack`.  
Currently, it's best to start `next dev` in `Webpack mode`.  
We plan to support Turbopack `next dev` once the Turbopack API or corresponding next features are released.



```ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  turbopack: {}
};

export default withPlumeria(nextConfig);
```

```json
"dev": "css & next dev --webpack",
```

If you are using next@16 or higher, continue using `next dev --webpack`.
