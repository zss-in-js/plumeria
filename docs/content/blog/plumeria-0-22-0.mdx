## Improvements and fixes
0.22.1 completely fixes the shorthand and longhand ordering issue.  
Shorthanded and longhanded rules are now properly filtered.

When using the eslint-plugin, shorthand rules always appear on top and longhand rules on the bottom. However, even when sorting without using eslint, filtering will ensure proper ordering.

## fixes
Fixed a bug where shorthand and longhand elements would not behave as expected in CSS when using media queries.
Class filtering is now performed properly even when the shorthand and longhand elements are used atomically.

## Imporvements
Along with @plumeria/core,
Testing for @plumeria/eslint-plugin and @plumeria/next-plugin and @plumeria/webpack-plugin and zss-engine has been completed.
During testing, small bugs and redundancies were removed, improving the quality of each.
