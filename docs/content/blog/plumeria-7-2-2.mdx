We have released Plumeria v7.2.2.
This update marks the most critical turning point in Plumeria's architecture.

We have finally moved beyond "Zero-Runtime Overhead" to reach a **"Compile-time Only"** architecture.

## Type Definition Only: The Complete Absence of Runtime Code

Until now, Plumeria has claimed to be "Zero-Runtime", which meant there was no overhead at execution time, but the library entity (JavaScript files) still existed.

Starting from v7.2.2, **the library entity has completely disappeared**.
Take a look at `package.json`.

```json
{
  "types": "lib/css.d.ts"
}
```

There is no `main`, no `module`. Only `types`.
You might wonder, "How does it work with only type definitions?"

### Static Extraction via Types

The essence of Plumeria is not a library, but a **"Compiler"**.

1.  **Development**: The editor references `css.d.ts` to provide powerful type completion and validation.
2.  **Build Time**: A dedicated plugin statically analyzes and extracts calls like `css.create`.
3.  **Output**: CSS files are generated, and all traces of Plumeria are completely removed from the JavaScript code.

Since not a single line of runtime code remains, there is no longer any need to include runtime JS files in the bundle.
This renders the concept of Tree-shaking obsolete. There are no leaves to shake off because there is no tree from the start.

## Ambient Modules and Syntax Highlighting

Accompanying this architectural change, we have adopted the **Ambient Module** format for type definitions, similar to Node.js modules like `fs`.

```ts
// css.d.ts
declare module "@plumeria/core" {
  // ...
}
```

This changes how it looks in your editor.
When you `import css from '@plumeria/core'`, `css` is highlighted not as a simple variable (e.g., Blue), but as a **Namespace/Module (e.g., Green)**.

```tsx
import css from '@plumeria/core';

// 'css' is recognized as a static module space,
// visually distinct from runtime variables.
const styles = css.create({ ... });
```

This symbolizes that Plumeria is not a loaded "library", but a "static system" that exists only in your development environment.

We also intentionally adopted a `Green.Yellow` color scheme, where `css` (Namespace) is Green and `create` (Function) is Yellow. This visually clarifies the boundary between the system (Namespace) and the action (Function), improving code readability.

## Conclusion

v7.2.2 is an ambitious update that concludes with **"eliminating the library code"** as the result of pursuing CSS-in-JS performance to the extreme.

- **Runtime**: 0 bytes (Not even in bundle)
- **Type Safety**: 99%
- **Architecture**: Compile-time Only
