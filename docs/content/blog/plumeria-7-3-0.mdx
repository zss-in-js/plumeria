We have released Plumeria v7.3.0.
This is a minor update that refines the type definitions introduced in v7.2.4.

## Refining the API Definition

In v7.2.4, we introduced a "Type Definition Only" architecture using `declare module`.
At that time, we defined APIs like `create` as functions:

```ts
// v7.2.4 (Previous)
export function create<T>(...): ...;
```

In v7.3.0, we have changed these to `const` exports typed with specific interfaces:

```ts
// v7.3.0 (Current)
export type create = <T>(...) => ...;
export const create: create;
```

This change brings two significant benefits:
1.  **Type Reusability**: You can now `import type { create }` and use the type directly in your code.
2.  **Accuracy**: Since Plumeria is a compile-time macro, `const` more accurately represents "a static symbol that will be replaced" rather than "a function that runs at runtime".

## The "Color" Discussion: Visual Philosophy

In the previous release notes (v7.2.4), we argued that having `css` (Namespace/Green) and `create` (Function/Yellow) as distinct colors was a feature:

> *We also intentionally adopted a `Green.Yellow` color scheme... This visually clarifies the boundary between the system (Namespace) and the action (Function)*

However, after further discussion and dogfooding, we have reconsidered this stance.

When using Plumeria, `css.create` is not just a function call; it is a **language extension**. It is a declarative part of your component definition, much like `const` or `type`.

By changing to `export const`, syntax highlighters will now treat `create` as a variable (often matching the color of `css` or other constants).

-   **Before (v7.2.4)**: High contrast. "Here is the System, and here is the Action."
-   **After (v7.3.0)**: Low contrast. "This is a static declaration block."

We found that this "calmer" appearance fits the mental model of a Zero-Runtime library much better. An atomic CSS declaration shouldn't scream "Function Execution!" with bright yellow; it should sit quietly as a definition, blending into your code structure.

## Summary

v7.3.0 is a refinement of our "Compile-time Only" philosophy.
By moving to `const` exports, we provide better TypeScript integration and a more coherent visual experience in your editor.

-   **API**: `function` -> `const`
-   **Visual**: High Contrast -> Integrated/Calm
-   **Runtime**: Still Zero (of course)
