## 6.3.1 Patch
- keyframes and viewTransition now supports inlining between files.  
After other APIs are resolved in the first pass, create is safely resolved in the second pass.

- fix: Fixed an issue where variants would not disappear completely.
- fix: Set cssCodeSplit to false in `vite-plugin`.
- fix: The optimizer (lightningcss + postcss-plugin processing) has been enabled for all loaders.  
This unifies the CSS in the production and development environments.


## 6.3.0 Minor
### ✨ Features
- **createTheme and createStatic are now fully functional**
- In previous versions, these APIs were not working correctly.
- This fix fully supports theming and static inline generation.

###
```ts
export const theme = createTheme({ primaryColor: { default:'#FF6B6B' } });
export const breakpoints = createStatic({ mobile: '768px' });
```

## Changes
### internal


- resolver path bugfix for createTheme and createStatic export case.
