## Minor update version
The change in `v2.2.4` that externalized `zss-engine` has been reverted.  
So, externalizing it was a mistake.

- Fixed a possibility of `ci failing`
- Remove unnecessary `type assertions`
- Use appropriate `parameter names`

This version `2.3.x` is a step forward in stability, and compared to `2.2.x`, fixes such as pseudo handling have been fully applied.


### Release v2.2.x
`v2.2.1` to `v2.2.3` have undergone internal refactoring of the core to improve code readability.  
- The npm `Unpacked Size` has been reduced by over `3 kB`.

### v2.2.4
- Fixed adding `:not(#\#)` to pseudo, it will no longer lose to long-handed flats.
- Fixed a pseudo hash duplication issue.
