## Fixed: Exported `createStatic` and `createTheme`

This patch release fixes a critical bug where **exported** `createStatic` and `createTheme` were not properly resolved during build time.

### The Problem

When you exported these functions:

```typescript
export const theme = createTheme({ primaryColor: { default:'#FF6B6B' } });
export const breakpoints = createStatic({ mobile: '768px' });
```

Member expressions like `theme.primaryColor` or `breakpoints.mobile` failed to resolve correctly in other modules.

### The Fix

- **Parser**: Separated `createTheme` and `createStatic` into dedicated hash/object tables
- **All Loaders**: Unified fix across `turbopack-loader`, `vite-plugin`, and `webpack-plugin`
- **Behavior**: 
  - `createTheme` now expands to CSS variables: `var(--primary-color)`
  - `createStatic` now inlines literal values correctly
  - Both work whether locally defined or imported

### Test Coverage

- **533 tests** with **99.81% branch coverage**
- **100% coverage** for `parser.ts`
