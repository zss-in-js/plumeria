## Changes
- $ accessor has been deprecated (deleted)
- Compilation target changed from `css.create` to `css.props()`
- The documentation has been significantly updated

Previously, calls to `css.create` were compiled, but now they are not compiled and the `css.props` argument is compiled instead. With this change, only the styles you put into `css.props()` will be compiled, keeping the output to a minimum.

## CSS specificity
css.props() is statically compiled by the AOT compiler with a list of arguments.  
Any property hashes from the left style that conflict with styles on the right are filtered and invalidated.

Specificity has become stricter and simpler.
When there is a property conflict, the property of the style on the right always takes precedence.
This is the same behavior as [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/).
```ts
css.props(styles.1, styles.2, styles.3) // 1 < 2 < 3 win
```

## Other Improvement

### Type
The following APIs have been typed:
- `css`
- `defineConsts`
```ts
const css: {
    prototype: StyleSheet;
    create: (object: CreateStyleType<T>) => ReturnType<T>;
    props: (...objects: (false | Readonly<CommonProperties> | Readonly<AndSelector> | Readonly<ColonSelector> | Readonly<QuerySelector> | Readonly<CSSVariableProperty> | null | undefined)[]) => string;
    keyframes: (object: CreateKeyframes) => string;
    defineConsts: (object: T) => T;
    defineVars: (object: T) => ReturnVariableType<T>;
    defineTheme: (object: T) => ReturnVariableType<T>;
    global: (object: HTMLSelector | ClassNameSelector | AttributeSelector | ConsecutiveSelector | PseudoClassSelector | PseudoElementSelector | KeyframesSelector | QuerySelectorHTML) => void;
}
```

```ts
const defineConsts = <const T extends CreateValues>(constants: T): T => {
  return constants;
};
```


### Import
`rx`, `px`, `ps`, `media`, `container`, `color`, these objects and functions now require imports rather than chaining them from css classes.
In the future the color object and px may be removed as needed.

```ts
import { rx, px, ps, media, container, color } from '@plumeria/core';
```

### Others

We have introduced API that may be deprecated in the future.
Because Atomic is focused on optimization, we plan to decide what to do with the `global()` API in the future.
We can't make any decisions without your actual opinions, so please share your thoughts through the discussion.
