## Significant improvements

- ESLint plugin has been refactored JavaScript to in TypeScript.
- Webpack plugin has been fixed a bug that caused duplicate creates to not compile.
- The documentation has been significantly updated.

## @plumeria/eslint-plugin
Starting from v0.19.4, we support eslint.config.ts that does not use jiti.

## @plumeria/webpack-plugin
create was compiled only when it was first found, but now all creates are managed in an array and compiled.
The next.js development experience has improved.

## Others
npm.js and monorepo readme improvements.
