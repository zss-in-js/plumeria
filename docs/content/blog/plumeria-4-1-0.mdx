## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where pseudo disappeared after **merging** by aligning the behavior of the compiler and plugin.

**The following packages have been modified:**
- `compiler`
- `vite-plugin`
- `webpack-plugin`
- `turbopack-loader`
- `utils`

The compiler and plugin merging process used in postcss-plugin has been unified with the `deepMerge` function.
This has corrected the behavior of `postcss-plugin` and it now outputs correctly.



## Other improved
- In 4.0.3 and above, the runtime `css.props` function is over 1.5x more efficient.  
Implementation [core/css.ts:Github](https://github.com/zss-in-js/plumeria/blob/main/packages/core/src/css.ts)

- Fixed a bug that caused the `x` function to not work.
