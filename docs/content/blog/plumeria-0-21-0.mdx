## Improvements and fixes

Consolidated the accumulated patch versions and fixed the core defineTokens.

- compiler: The rule that the left wins is that when using conditional expressions, you cannot toggle by overwriting unless there is a base property, so we decided to treat conditional expressions specially.
- webpack-plugin: When the development server is started, even for pages with a single component, styles are cleared when navigating, and the next reflection is applied.
- eslint-plugin: Improved consistency in ordering of flex and sort-properties in rule value-vlidate.
- core: Fixed defineTokens keys not being kebab-case.

Below are the important bug fixes implemented in 0.20.


## rscute@0.2.7 -> rscute@0.2.8
We were using rscute 0.2.7, but by using the significantly updated `register` API in rscute@0.2.8, we have reduced the startup bottleneck.



enableCompileCache: @since â€” v22.8.0  
The compiler requires Node 22.8.0 or higher.
