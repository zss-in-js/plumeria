## Changes

### Fix: Fixed CSS bloat during HMR

Fixed an issue where appends to `zero-virtual.css` piled up each time HMR occurred in the development environment, causing the file to continue to bloat on disk.

This issue has been resolved by inserting post-processing after `appendFileSync` to replace the file with the confirmed content rather than the difference.

#### Impact

The Next.js development server display `✓ Compiled in xx ms` one more time. This is due to post-processing and is normal behavior.

## Migration guide

Backward compatibility is maintained.  
You can safely migrate to `v7.5.0` without any special changes.

## Other
Minification by optimizer is now fixed to production only.
```ts
minify: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
```

This is useful for debugging, as you can see the HMR output directly when opening `zero-virtual.css` in development mode.
