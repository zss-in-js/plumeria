## Atomic pseudos
Pseudo-class pseudo-elements were semantically scoped as a six-character hash, but have been atomized to accommodate scaling.
```sh
{
  '::before:display': 'x6lhpo6k',
  '::before:width': 'xuxybnne',
  '::before:height': 'xefh6uws',
  '::before:content': 'xw4ahafk',
  '::before:backgroundColor': 'xjhvq7pr'
}
```
## Compile scan count is o(1)
The scan is now skipped after all caches are resolved for the first time:
- postcss-plugin compiling
- Loading the loader for the first time

Build speed is improved, and the initial scan takes just a few milliseconds to fill the entire hash table.  
The postcss-plugin is now enabled again when starting development mode. This will speed up initial rendering by filling the atomic map table.

## Other
- Fixed an issue where styles did not have the correct values by building it from an atomic map table.
- The example repository has been expanded: [`monorepo/examples`](https://github.com/zss-in-js/plumeria/tree/main/examples).
