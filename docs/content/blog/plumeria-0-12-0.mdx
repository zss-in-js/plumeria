## Imporved a way for return class name.  

- `styles.$name` can now be used as a `className` **accessor**.

**Example**: `styles.$button`

The previous `styles.button` (object) can still be used.

### definingStyles

```ts
const styles = css.create({
  button: {
    color: "blue",
  },
  size: {
    width: 24,
    height: 24,
  },
})
```

```tsx
<div className={styles.$button} /> // assign a string directly
```
You can put it directly as a string by prepending a `$`, this will act as a key hash **directly**.  
This is useful if you want to apply a **single** style.

The class name is not meta information of the style object, but an **artifact(representation)** of the style.
Therefore, it is provided in a flat structure: `styles.$name`.

> Provides a clean separation between design `(objects)` and presentation `(class names)`.  
Apply a single style intuitively with `styles.$name` . Apply multiple or conditional styles explicitly with `css.props()`.

If you want to apply multiple classes as per the previous syntax, the following syntax is supported:

```tsx
<div className={css.props(styles.button, styles.size)} />
```
