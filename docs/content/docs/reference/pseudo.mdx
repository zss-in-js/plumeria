description: 'Comprehensive API reference for the `pseudo` utility in the zss-utils package, covering all pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, and functional pseudo selectors.'
---

## Overview

The `ps(pseudo selector)` utility allows developers to apply CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements directly within JavaScript or TypeScript code using `@plumeria/core`. This is particularly useful for dynamic styling in modern web applications, such as single-page apps or component-based frameworks. By leveraging these utilities, you can create responsive and interactive styles with minimal CSS boilerplate.

<Callout title="Available to clients only">
  If you require AST parsing and compilation for an RSC preview such as Next.js, you cannot use these zss-utils libraries and must instead define static variables using the defineConsts API.
</Callout>



## Usage
```ts title="TypeScript"
import { ps } from 'zss-utils';
```

## Pseudo-Classes

### Standard Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo-classes target elements based on their state, position, or user interaction. Below is a comprehensive list of all supported pseudo-classes in the `pseudo` utility.

| Pseudo-Class                  | Description                                                                  | Example Use Case                                      |

## Usage Examples

Below are practical examples demonstrating how to use the `pseudo` utility with `@plumeria/core`.

### Example 1: Styling a Button with Hover and Focus

```ts title="TypeScript Example"
import { css } from '@plumeria/core';
import { ps } from 'zss-utils';

const buttonStyles = css.create({
  button: {
    background: 'blue',
    color: 'white',
    padding: '10px 20px',
    [ps.hover]: {
      background: 'darkblue',
    },
    [ps.focus]: {
      outline: '2px solid yellow',
    },
  },
});
```

## Example 2: Combining Pseudo-Classes with px

```ts
import { ps, px } from 'zss-utils';

const combinedStyles = px(ps.active, ps.focusVisible, ps.fn.has('div'));
```

## Example 3: Using Functional Pseudo-Classes

```ts
import { css } from '@plumeria/core';
import { ps } from 'zss-utils';

const listStyles = css.create({
  list: {
    [ps.fn.nthChild('2n')]: {
      background: 'lightgray',
    },
    [ps.fn.has('img')]: {
      border: '1px solid black',
    },
  },
});
```

## Example 4: Styling Pseudo-Elements

```ts
import { css } from '@plumeria/core';
import { ps } from 'zss-utils';

const textStyles = css.create({
  text: {
    [ps.firstLetter]: {
      fontSize: '1.5em',
      color: 'red',
    },
    [ps.before]: {
      content: '"★ "',
      color: 'gold',
    },
  },
});
```
