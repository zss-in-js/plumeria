import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

The `create` for defines static, component-scoped styles using plain JavaScript style objects.  
It is **type-safe keys**, **compile-time validation**, and **scoped class names** through automatic hashing.

Only the styles you use in `props()` will be compiled.

## Example

```tsx title="TypeScript"
import * as css from '@plumeria/core'

const styles = css.create({
  container: {
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: '14px',
    textDecoration: 'none',
  },
})

const className = css.props(styles.container, styles.text)
```


If they are defined in the same file, they will be replaced directly with the hash.  
The same is true if you are exporting a file boundary, which is safely extracted as a hash, the original create call is replaced with an empty string, and the reference is broken, so it statically resolves to zero in the bundle.
  
**Compiled:**
```tsx
className: "xxp6epoh xwbwwha1 xbief8v4 xzllkng3"
```

**Generated CSS:**

```css
.xxp6epoh {
  display: flex;
}
.xwbwwha1 {
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.xbief8v4:not(#\#) {
  font-size: 14px;
}
.xzllkng3 {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```


Plumeria compiles each style property into a unique, **atomic**, and **hashed** class name. This prevents style collisions and maximizes reusability.

<Callout title="Atomic API">
Unique atom classes are reused without duplication, keeping the amount of class names constant.
