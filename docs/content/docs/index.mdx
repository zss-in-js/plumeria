Welcome to the Plumeria documentation!

Plumeria is an atomic Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library with JavaScript and TypeScript syntax and compilation.
It creates optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS, reducing refactoring needs while scaling components efficiently.
It helps developers focus on what to style, not how to style it.
This approach is more efficient than what you can create and manage manually.

## Features at a glance

### Scalable
- Efficient and minimal output with atomic CSS.
- CSS size remains constant even as the number of components increases.
- Styles are maintained by the CLI, making them easy to read and maintain.

### Predictable
- The last style applied always takes precedence.
- All specificity levels are 1, determined only by the order in which they are applied.
- There are no special rules—the rightmost style always wins.

### Fast
- No runtime style injection.
- All styles are compiled into a single CSS file at build time.
- Optimized function for merging class names.

### Type-Safe
- Type-safe APIs.
- Type-safe styles.
- Type-safe built in [csstype](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csstype?activeTab=code).
