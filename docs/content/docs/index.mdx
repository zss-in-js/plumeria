<br/>
Welcome to the Plumeria documentation!

## What it's like

**Zero-runtime Atomic CSS-in-JS library**.  

flat syntax and compilation.
It creates optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS, reducing refactoring needs while scaling components efficiently.
It helps developers focus on what to style, not how to style it.
**This approach provides a more refined and maintainable alternative to manual workflows**.

### Purpose
Spend less time writing CSS, keep styles beautiful.  
Declarative and intuitive by design.  
Portability, migration ease, and forward-thinking architecture.

### Principles
JavaScript/TypeScript-first, powered by a **simple CLI**.  
**Two** constraints: **type-safe** styles・**flat** nesting structure.  

### Strengths
- Fully **static compiler**
- Fully **zero-runtime architecture**
- Fully **type-safe TypeScript and csstype lib**
- Completely **predictable**
- More **flexible**, more **lightweight**

### Culture
Plumeria embraces an optimistic syntax philosophy.  
It avoids unnecessary constraints and deep nesting,  
offering a declarative, TS-guided authoring experience that  
makes migrating from other libraries effortless.
