## Thinking in Plumeria

---

## Atomic CSS
It creates optimized styles using collision-free atomic classes, reducing refactoring needs while scaling components efficiently.

## ESLint (oxlint) linting for CI
This approach provides a more refined and maintainable means to automate workflows.

## Zero-code design
Zero app bundle and zero runtime code.
Typical CSS-in-JS solutions use several kilobytes in initial bundle size, but this library is designed to eliminate all code in the bundle by eliminate completely function calls.

## Optimization
Normally, build speed increases linearly as the application size increases, but Plumeria's compiler builds all tables in a few milliseconds, and the build then finishes at the same speed as a normal build.
