Welcome to the Plumeria documentation!

## What it's like

**Zero-runtime Atomic CSS-in-JS library**.  
flat syntax and compilation.
It creates optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS, reducing refactoring needs while scaling components efficiently.
It helps developers focus on what to style, not how to style it.
This approach is more efficient than what you can create and manage manually.



### Principles
JavaScript/TypeScript-first, powered by a simple CLI.  
Two constraints: type-safe styles・flat nesting structure.  

### Purpose
Spend less time writing CSS, keep styles beautiful.  
Declarative and intuitive by design.


### Strengths
More flexible, more lightweight.  
Plumeria is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library that balances  
portability, migration ease, and forward-thinking architecture.

### Culture
Plumeria embraces an optimistic syntax philosophy.  
It avoids unnecessary constraints and deep nesting,  
offering a declarative, TS-guided authoring experience that  
makes migrating from other libraries effortless.
