Welcome to the Plumeria documentation!

Plumeria is a atomic Zero-Runtime CSS-in-JS library, efficient style — build optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS, refactoring less and scaling the number of components optimistically.

It helps developers focus on **what** to style, not **how** to style it.

## Features at an overview

### Scalable
- Efficient and minimal output with atomic CSS.
- The CSS size it will be constant even if the number of components increases.
- Styles are maintained by the CLI, making them easy to read and maintainable.

### Predictable
- The last style applied always takes precedence.
- All specificity levels are 1, determined only by the left right order in which they are applied.
- Therefore, there are no special rules other than that the right wins.

### Fast
- No runtime style injection.
- All styles are collocated at compile-time into a single CSS file.
- Optimized function for merging class names.

### Type-Safe
- Type-safe APIs.
- Type-safe styles.
- Type-safe values.
