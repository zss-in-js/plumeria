## Type-Only design
Typical CSS-in-JS solutions use several kilobytes in initial bundle size. This library completely replaces function calls and is complete with just type definitions and plugins.
Developers simply extend the type definition arguments as **schemas**, so no JS parsing is required and there are no memory allocation costs.

## Atomic CSS
It creates optimized styles using collision-free atomic classes, reducing refactoring needs while scaling components efficiently.

## ESLint (oxlint) linting for CI
This approach provides a more refined and maintainable means to automate workflows.

## Optimization
Normally, build speed increases linearly as the application size increases, but Plumeria's compiler builds all tables in a few milliseconds, and the build then finishes at the same speed as a normal build.
