Using variants, you can switch between predefined style keys for a component via properties.
In the passing `"white" | "pink" | "green"` to the color property, the corresponding styles will be applied to the `Button`.


## Example
The type of the property must be returned by the `create` method using `keyof` `typeof`.  
eg: `color: keyof typeof styles`.
```tsx
import { css } from '@plumeria/core';

const colorVariant = css.create({
  white: {
    color: 'white',
  },
  pink: {
    color: 'pink',
  },
  green: {
    color: 'green',
  },
});

type ColorVariant = keyof typeof colorVariant;
// or
type ColorVariantProps = 'white' | 'pink' | 'green';

export const Button = ({ color }: { color: ColorVariant }) => {
  return <button className={css.props(colorVariant[color])}>Button</button>;
};

<Button color="white" />;
<Button color="pink" />;
<Button color="green" />;
```

Since variants refer to all of their creates, there is a cost associated with keeping a hash map as a reference.  
To minimize this cost, it is best practice to separate create and limit it to variants only, such as colorVariant, and separate it from the regular styles = create.
