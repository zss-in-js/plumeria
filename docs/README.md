## Where - Does Plumeria Shine?

Plumeria excels in **JavaScript/TypeScript-first environments,** powered by a simple CLI. Built on two core constraints: **type-safe styles** and **flat nesting structure.**

**Integration Excellence:**

- React/Next.js projects with seamless TypeScript support
- VSCode with editor snippets (type `css` + Tab → `className={css.props()}`)
- ESLint integration with `@plumeria/eslint-plugin` for auto-linting and style sorting
- Full IDE support with go-to-definition navigation across your codebase

**Culture & Philosophy:**
Plumeria embraces an optimistic syntax philosophy that avoids unnecessary constraints. It offers a declarative, TypeScript-guided authoring experience with no deep nesting, making migration from other libraries effortless and development a pleasure.
How - How to Get Started?

1. **Editor Setup (VSCode):**
   Create a snippet for instant `className` expansion:

- Open Command Palette: `Shift + Cmd + P`
- Select: "Snippets: Configure Snippets"
- Choose: `typescriptreact.json` or `javascriptreact.json`
- Add the snippet configuration

2. **ESLint Integration:**
   Install @plumeria/eslint-plugin for automatic linting, syntax error catching, and auto-sorting of styles. Configure with flat config ESM, CJS, or ESLint 8 formats.
3. **Start Styling:**
   Use the `css` macro with full TypeScript intellisense. Jump to definitions with `Cmd/Alt + click`, even when styles aren't written directly in JSX.

**What You Get:**

- **Editor snippets** - Type `css` + Tab to instantly expand syntax
- **Auto-linting** - Catch errors and auto-sort styles automatically
- **Go-to-definition** - Navigate directly from CSS prop to style definitions across your entire codebase
