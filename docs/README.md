Built on two foundational principles: **type-safe styles** and **flat nesting structure**.

### Integration Excellence

- **React/Next.js** — Seamless TypeScript integration for modern frameworks
- **VSCode** — Smart editor snippets (type `css` + Tab → `className={css.props()}`)
- **ESLint** — Automatic linting and style sorting via `@plumeria/eslint-plugin`
- **IDE Navigation** — Go-to-definition support across your entire codebase

### Philosophy & Culture

Plumeria embraces an **optimistic syntax philosophy** that eliminates unnecessary constraints. It delivers a declarative, TypeScript-guided authoring experience with flat nesting, making migration from other libraries effortless and development genuinely enjoyable.

## How

### 1. Editor Setup (VSCode)

Create a snippet for instant `className` expansion:

1. Open Command Palette: `Shift + Cmd + P`
2. Select: **"Snippets: Configure Snippets"**
3. Choose: `typescriptreact.json` or `javascriptreact.json`
4. Add the snippet configuration

### 2. ESLint Integration

Install `@plumeria/eslint-plugin` for automatic linting, error detection, and style sorting.

Configuration supports multiple formats: flat config ESM, CJS, or legacy ESLint 8.

### 3. Start Styling

Use the `css` macro with full TypeScript intellisense. Navigate to definitions with `Cmd/Alt + Click`, even when styles aren't colocated with JSX.

### Developer Benefits

- **Instant snippets** — Type `css` + Tab for immediate syntax expansion
- **Automatic linting** — Catch errors and auto-sort styles in real-time
- **Smart navigation** — Jump directly from CSS props to definitions anywhere in your codebase
